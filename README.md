# COVID DATA PLOTS 

This repository contains a simple Python script to plot Italian COVID-19 data.  

The data is provided by Civil Protection Department (Dipartimento Protezione Civile) and can be found [here](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19)

I made this script for me to have a better understanding of what is the COVID situation like in Italy.  
I hope that it might be useful also for others! 

### How do I get set up?

* Clone this repo
* Clone data 
```
git clone https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.git
```
* Run the script
```
python ./make_graphs.py
```

### TODO
* regional data plot as script parameter
* province data plot as script parameter
* covid data auto update when calling the script
* covid data clone if not available
